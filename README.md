# EMSProject
This EMS is able to add new Employees, update Employee information, remove Employees, and list Employee information. The
user interface (U/I) will be the Java console, where you can print the program information, and take in inputs from the userâ€™s standard input (the
keyboard). You will need to have a basic menu with options to navigate your application for your users to interact with.
# Requirements
- Use the principles of OOP in your design. I.e. encapsulate relevant code together.  Break down methods and classes with separation of concerns (not
  everything in one big main method), so that each part of the code is focused on doing one task.
- Employees should store the following at minimum: first name, last name, employee id (needs to be unique), Date of Employment, salary, and
  department as a String.
- Implement the use of at least one custom exception.
- Implement at least one Java stream.
- Use Exception handling in all appropriate places.
- Have a console based U/I menu system that allows the user to navigate through the app and perform all of the CRUD operations listed above.
# Tools and Language Used
This application is programmed in Java and Eclipse is used as the runtime environment.
